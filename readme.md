1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/umama-khanam/WeatherNow.git
Open script.js and replace the placeholder "YOUR_API_KEY" with your own OpenWeatherMap API key:

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // replace with your own key

How to Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key

Go to OpenWeatherMap
.

Sign up and confirm your email.

Create a free API key and copy it.

Use this key in your script.js as shown above.

Notes

For public GitHub, the API key is hidden using a placeholder.

The live demo link works because the real API key is set as an environment variable in CodeSandbox.

Anyone cloning the repo locally must generate their own API key to run the app.
